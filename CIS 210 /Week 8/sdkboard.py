    """One tile on a Sudoku board.
    Public data atributes: 
        row: integer 0..8  (position on board, read only after creating)
        col: integer 0..8  (position on board, read only after creating)
        symbol: String '1','2', .. '9' or '.'  (read-write in solver)
             A digit '1' .. '9' is a choice that has been made;
             The OPEN symbol is a choice that has not yet been made. 
        possible: set of possible symbols that could be here (read-write in solver)

    It is permitted to directly access tile.row, tile.col, tile.symbol, and tile.possible
    (that is what calling them "public" means).  However, they should not be changed
    directly.  Change their values only by calling methods in this class. 

    Invariant:
        The "possible" set always includes the potential correct symbol in
        this tile, provided the board is solvable. Thus, if there is only
        one symbol in "possible", that must be the correct symbol for the tile.

    Events:
        listeners are functions called to announce certain events in a user
        interface (whether graphical or textual).  Currently supported event
        types are "duplicate" (this tile is a duplicate of another in a row,
        column, or block);  "determined"  (this tile was OPEN, but we just
        figured out what digit it must be); and "constrained"  (we just trimmed
        down the "possible" set of symbols, making progress toward a solution).
