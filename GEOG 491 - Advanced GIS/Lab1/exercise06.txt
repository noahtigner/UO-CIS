1. Result objects can contain more information than a single string or int (ie lists of strings, timestamps, etc.)
2. A unicode string is a sequence of unicode characters (as opposed to ascii). Unicode is better for international characters as unicode has a larger variety of characters than ascii. All python 3 strings are unicode.
3. The 'r' at the beginning of a string tells the python interpreter that a string is raw and should be taken literally - meaning escape characters ("/") should be read literally and not used to escape other characters. This is useful for filepaths.
