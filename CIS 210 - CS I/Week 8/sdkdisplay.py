Sudoku board display. 
Author: M Young, Nov 10 2012 for CIS 210

Designed for a simple model/view/controller architecture, 
in which the board display knows about the sudoku board, 
and not vice versa.  Communication from the sudoku board
to the board display is by event notifications through 
registered listeners.
